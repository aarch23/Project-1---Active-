This research exercise was done in order to understand if we could create an model to build an investment portfolio that outperforms the S&P Broad Crypto Digital Market Index. Due to the expansive nature and sheer *large/massive* number of investable assets in the Crypto space, it can get quite complex, since there are many variables that need to be taken into account when investing. Our model and future platform, provide a safe option for investors to gain exposure to these markets while outperforming the *Main market index*/SPCBDM ?
